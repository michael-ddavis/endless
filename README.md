# Endless Website Coding Challenge

## How to build and run this project

1. Download the project by opening your terminal and paste one of these three commands (using HTTPS will be the easiest):

SSH

```
git@github.com:michael-ddavis/endless.git
```

HTTPS

```
git clone https://github.com/michael-ddavis/endless.git
```

Github CLI 

```
gh repo clone michael-ddavis/endless
```

2. Once that command has finisehd running, 'cd' into that directory and run 'npm i'. This will install all of the modules needed for the application to run properly. 

```
$ npm i
```

3. Once this is completed, run 'npm start'. A window or tab will open displaying the Endless website. Happy Reviewing :)

```
$ npm start
```
